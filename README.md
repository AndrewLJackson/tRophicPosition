# tRophicPosition
A package to estimate trophic position using SIA.

If you are reading this, then you are on the GitHub site and/or have download the version from there. 

As of 16th of November 2016, we are releasing the version 0.4.0.1000 of the package, that is ready for beta-testing. Probably you will find a number of errors, so we encourage you to send them to trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com

In the following weeks, we will be sending this package to CRAN, and will put here more news on how to cite properly this package.
