Description: Estimates the trophic position of a consumer relative to a baseline
    species. It implements a Bayesian approach wich combines an interface to
    the JAGS MCMC library of rjags and stable isotopes. This is the version 0.3
    beta, so users are encouraged to test every possibility within the package
    and send bugs and reports to trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com
