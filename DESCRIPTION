Description: Estimates the trophic position of a consumer relative to a baseline
    species. It implements a Bayesian approach wich combines an interface to
    the JAGS MCMC library of rjags and stable isotopes. This is the version 0.6.8-7, 
    so users are encouraged to test every possibility within the package
    and send bugs and reports to trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com.
