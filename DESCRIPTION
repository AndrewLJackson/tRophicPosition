Description: This package estimates the trophic position of a consumer relative 
    to a baseline species. It implements a Bayesian approach which combines an 
    interface to the JAGS MCMC library of rjags and stable isotopes. This is the
    version 0.7, so users are encouraged to test the  package and send bugs and 
    trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com.
