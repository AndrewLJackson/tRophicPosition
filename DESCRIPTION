Description: Estimates the trophic position of a consumer relative 
    to a baseline species. It implements a Bayesian approach which combines an 
    interface to the 'JAGS' MCMC library of 'rjags' and stable isotopes. Users are
    encouraged to test the package and send bugs and/or errors to
    trophicposition-support@googlegroups.com.
